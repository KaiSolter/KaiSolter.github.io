To run the game clone the repositiory onto your machine, open the upe-project file, then navigate to the my-app file. 

From the my-app file run the command 'npm start' if you have npm (node project manager)
or say 'yarn start' if you have yarn (yet another project manager) 

If you need to install npm run 'npm install -g npm'


I used a template to get started and create my file structure, so addition instructions can be found in the README in the my-app fie
